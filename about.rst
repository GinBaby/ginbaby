Soooooo

The whole point of this blog is to tell stories, mostly about people I've known. I like people. People are weird and beautiful and upsetting and funny and perfectly imperfect in their habits and morals, and I wish I could know them all, even if only a little. 

I will not use people's real names. There will be recurring characters, I expect.

There aren't meant to be lessons here. Just memories.
